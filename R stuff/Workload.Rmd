WORKLOAD analysis

From WORKLOAD backup file, saved on 25/7/2015
Get to the directory and print out the data set
```{r}
setwd("c:/users/cdiloreto/desktop/work")
library(xlsx)
workload = read.xlsx("WORKLOAD backup.xlsx", sheetName = "Weekly Overview")
View(workload)
```

Problems: 
* x and y are somewhat upside down, dataset would make more sense as x = countries and y = dates
* dates - how to read them into R

--> try get the data from the database
